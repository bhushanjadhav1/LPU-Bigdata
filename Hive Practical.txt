To create table and load data from file located in local file system

-In hive type command, 
    > create table emp(Name string, City string, contact bigint) 
    row format delimited
    fields terminated by ','
    stored as textfile;

  >desc post;;

[training@localhost ~]$ hadoop fs -cat /user/hive/warehouse/post/userp

 Querying

>select count(1) from post;
>drop table post;

hive> CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE posts
> (user STRING, post STRING, time BIGINT)
> ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
> FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
> STORED AS TEXTFILE
> LOCATION '/training/hive/';  


hive> CREATE TABLE post1 (user STRING, post STRING, time BIGINT)
    > PARTITIONED BY(country STRING)                            
    > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED                                      
    > FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','                                  
    > STORED AS TEXTFILE;      

desc post1;

show partitions post1;

Now create two files userp-US and userp-AUS with same format(3 columns)

Then load it using the command

hive> load data local inpath '/home/training/userp-AUS'
    > overwrite into table post1 partition (country='AUS');

hive> load data local inpath '/home/training/userp-US'
    > overwrite into table post1 partition (country='US');

To check the partitions;

show partitions;

To check in HDFS

[training@localhost ~]$ hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/post1

[training@localhost ~]$ hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/post1/country=AUS

[training@localhost ~]$ hadoop fs -cat /user/hive/warehouse/post1/country=AUS/userp-AUS

Querying the partioned table
select * from post1 where country='US' limit 1;   




JOINS
Create two tables customers and orders
Columns of customers table are id,name,age,address,salary
columns of orders table are oid,c_id,amount

Insert data into both of them


Default join is Inner join
hive> select c.id,c.name,c.age,o.amount
    > from customers c join orders o   
    > on (c.id=o.c_id); 


Left  Join
hive> select c.id,c.name,o.amount 
    > from customers c
    > left outer join orders o
    > on(c.id=o.c_id);

Right join
 select c.id,c.name,o.amount
    > from customers c           
    > right outer join orders  o 
    > on (c.id=o.c_id);

 
Full outer join
hive> select c.id,c.name,o.amount 
    > from customers c
    > full outer join orders o
    > on (c.id=o.c_id);
